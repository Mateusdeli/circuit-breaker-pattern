Simple application to simulate the circuit breaker design pattern in order to control failure requests making the application more resilient and scalable.

The "microservice-app" folder simulates the client microservice, while the "microservice-external" folder is simulating a microservice that can return success or failure.

Install the dependencies for both microservices with the command "npm install", to run the application run the command "npm run dev" as specified in the package.json.
